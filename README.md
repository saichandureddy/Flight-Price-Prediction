# Flight-Price-Prediction
In this project, we analyzed the flight prices dataset and performed EDA to discover the hidden patterns, important variables, to know how does the flights tickets are priced.

Introduction:

In today's dynamic travel landscape, predicting flight prices has become an essential aspect for both travelers seeking cost-effective options and airlines aiming to optimize revenue. The myriad of factors influencing ticket costs, such as seasonality, route popularity, day of the week, and class distinctions, makes flight price prediction a challenging yet valuable endeavor.

In this project, the goal is to leverage data analytics and machine learning techniques to build a robust flight price prediction model. The dataset, likely comprising features like departure and arrival cities, dates, airlines, and possibly more, holds the key to unraveling patterns and trends that contribute to the variability in ticket prices.

Approach:

Data Collection: Acquire a comprehensive dataset containing historical flight information. This dataset should encompass a diverse range of routes, airlines, and temporal variations to ensure the model captures the complexity of the market.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into the distribution of flight prices, identify correlations between features, and uncover any notable patterns. Visualization tools can aid in understanding the data's underlying structure.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature engineering may involve extracting relevant information from timestamps, creating new variables, or encoding categorical data.

Feature Selection: Choose the most influential features for predicting flight prices. This step involves selecting variables that contribute the most to the model's predictive power while minimizing unnecessary complexity.

Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks. Algorithms like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines are commonly employed for predicting numerical values.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the selected model. Optimize hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance and ensure its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others. This step helps gauge how well the model predicts flight prices compared to the actual values.

Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's accuracy, deploy it for real-time predictions. Users can input relevant details, and the model will output an estimated flight price based on the learned patterns.

By undertaking this project, we aim to provide a valuable tool for travelers and industry stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding flight choices and pricing strategies. Through the integration of data analytics and machine learning, we endeavor to bring efficiency and precision to the realm of flight price prediction.

Research Questions
The aim of our study is to answer the below research questions:
a) Does price vary with Airlines?
b) How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?
c) Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
d) How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?
e) How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
f) How does the price changes with number of stops in the travel?
